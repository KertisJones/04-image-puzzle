# 04-image-puzzle

I'll admit it. This is almost a complete rip from the sample solution that was given. But hey, all's fair in love, war and programming. To make up for this shameless act of plagiarism, I've replaced the colored squares with everyone's favorite year-old meme -- and an even older meme appears when you win! The background music is the classic tune from Tetris.

Your first pygame project! This is the fourth programming assignment for ILS-Z399. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "sliding puzzle" game
* A popular variant of the sliding puzzle game is the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). That would be a good place to start
* Using pygame, draw a window and graphics inside the window
* Capture mouse or keyboard events (or both) to enable user interaction
* Report a winning condition if the player completes the puzzle
* Extra credit will be awarded if the puzzle is an image rather than colored shapes (but get the shapes working first!)
* You can assume that the user will have pygame installed on their system
* This is a big step up in complexity, so ask for help if you run into trouble!

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun. Also, remember to edit the README.md and LICENSE files.

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* How to use the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [Classes and objects](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) will probably be useful
* [The Game Loop](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/gamedev-glossary-what-is-the-game-loop--gamedev-2469) and [pygame events](http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2014/05/Pygame-modules-for-interactive-programs)
